<h1>Github: The Place for Open Source Software</h1>

There was a time when software wasn't free. Yes, there was Free Software Foundation (FSF) and there was SourceForge but there was no GitHub. Software used to be primarily proprietary and there were were licenses that enabled freeware and shareware.
Nowadays people release their source for free under permissive licenses. Such as GNU or MIT licenses.
