<h1>Github: The Place for Open Source Software</h1>

There was a time when software wasn't free. Yes, there was Free Software Foundation (FSF) and there was SourceForge but there was no GitHub. Software used to be primarily proprietary and there were were licenses that enabled freeware and shareware.
Nowadays people release their source for free under permissive licenses. Such as GNU or MIT licenses.



<h1> Binary Analysis </h1>
Before software was open-source you would have to reverse engineer the software to know what it was doing. Using tools like IDA Pro and SoftIce. By understanding the way the software would work you could make a reversed copy of the software or add features to the software.


<h1>Coding with Open Source</h1>
Because software is open source, you can read the code and add changes to the code for whatever project you find on github.

<h1>Personal Musings</h1>
I would like to learn about Game Bots, Web Crawlers and White Hat Security Tools as a software security specialist. Right now I'm getting comfortable with coding learning Racket, in the future I would like to learn more Python, C/C++ and Go
